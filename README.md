# KSU_FirstYearScholars25-26

This repository is part of a First Year Scholars project at Kennesaw State University. The aim is to train a convolutional neural network to separate between quark- and gluon-initited jets. 

# Workflow

Here is the current workflow for the repository:

```python
python train.py
```
(on Andreas's MacBook pro use ```/Users/apapaefs/miniconda3/bin/python```)

This will generate ```training_results.pdf```
